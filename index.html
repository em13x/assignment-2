						<div class="content">
							<p>The internet and other types of communication systems are things that we use on the daily, and yet we never really think about how they work nor their presence in the physical world. To make these systems and infrastructures work, generally mass cable systems are needed to send information from one place to another. These cables don’t just link a country together; they link countries to other countries, continents to other continents. These submarine cables are so vital to today’s society, and most people who use them don’t even know they exist, or don’t care about their existence until something goes wrong. </p>
<p>That’s where ORB comes in.</p>
<p>ORB is a conceptual phone application in which users can discover and monitor the status of submarine and subterranean cables around the world. This would serve a multitude of purposes, from internet and electrical infrastructure education for students, to a globalised monitoring tool for internet and electricity providers. It would even allow for people who are experiencing internet blackouts or lag to discover exactly where and why the situation is occurring, if the problem is due to the monitored cables.</p>

<p> Beginning at the landing page, users have the option to either regsiter or login to access the app. There's also a "help" button below to give instructions on how the app works.
	However, for the purposes of this prototype, users can directly click the "register" or "login" buttons at the bottom of their respective screens, or by simply clicking the logo on the intial landing page, to access the app, without putting in any personal details.
</p>
<p>The main home screen features the interactive globe. As this is a prototype, the Earth isn't maneuverable as it would be in the real app, but is instead static to simply give users a feel for how the main screen would look and work.
	Users can choose different points on the globe to learn more about specific submarine cables.
	This brings up a new screen with the desired information. Users can click the "back" button at the bottom of the screen to return to the main home screen.
</p>
<p>In the top right corner, the simplified logo acts at the menu button. Selecting it brings up a new screen with a menu list that users can use to navigate the app.
</p>
<p>The "News" page displays the latest news from around the internet to do with the topic of submarine cables. In the full version of the app, users would be able to simply click on one of the thumbnails and be taken to the corresponding news webpage.
</p>
<p>The "Random" function randomly chooses a submarine cable and presents it to the user; a great function for discovering new and interesting cables!
</p>
<p>The "FAQ" page is the same as the "Help" page accessible from the landing page, except with the option to go back to the main menu instead of the landing page.
</p>
<p>Lastly, the "Log Out" function brings the user to a farewell screen, before directing them back to the landing page.
</p>
<p>Overall, the orb app prototype is one that is simple yet effective; easy to navigate, in an organic workflow that should make sense to any tech user.</p>

										<h2>Development & Progress Log</h2>

									<div class="content">
								<a>01/09/2020</a>
								<p>Taking my pitch from Project 1, I'll be developing part of a functional prototype for my brand and app, Orb.

As I do not have the coding abilities to code an app (I have decent HTML and CSS but only very entry level Java etc), I've decided to create a 2D animated sequence showing how the app would be used. For example, transitions from one screen to another, movement of elements etc. This should serve to give the public (ie. the class) a good idea of how the app itself would look and work. Essentially, it's an onboarding sequence.

I am somewhat proficient in motion graphic design, so creating the animation will be time-consuming but definitely not out of my skill level. I will be creating the animation from scratch, not using any drag-and-drop UI/UX templates etc.

I'm excited for this project!
</p>
<a>07/09/2020</a>
<p>Today I got all my assets together so that over the next week I can start keyframing and animating in Adobe After Effects!

I created some very rough mockups for Project 1 of the app icon and app interface, which are all things I'll use in the animated prototype.

Over the weekend, I created this slightly-stylised iPhone overlay template, which will be used to frame the animated prototype and add context to the animation (as it wouldn't look the same if the animation was just playing without a proper phone to frame it).</p>

<p>I set up my Illustrator files this way so that it's super easy to take over into After Effects.</p>
<a>09/09/2020</a>
<p>After yesterday's lecture (which was really helpful in terms of examples of prototypes) I've changed my project idea.</p>
<p>
I will be using Invision and Invision Studio to create a working prototype of the app. I don't know if I'll be able to get the "earth" to spin (it might be better to animate that separately and insert it as an mp4/gif file into the prototype, or I could keep it static with different points that could be clicked on to display different information), but I'll figure an alternative out.
</p><p>
So today I just got started by downloading the Invision Studio application and playing around with it, trying to familiarise myself with the tools, workspace and workflow. It really impressed me how the software is all free, I think it's such an important and unique tool for designers such as myself who don't know a thing about app coding but know how they want an app to look.
</p>

									<p></p>
<a>10/09/2020</a>
<p>Today I started creating my app prototype in Invision Studio. The more I use the software the easier the development becomes.
</p><p>
At the moment I'm making the landing screen work - linking buttons to different pages etc. I need to create a "register" and "log in" page, which I'll do tomorrow. Of course, you'll be able to bypass this to go straight to the main page. I won't be able to make the sphere "turn" so I'll animate that in After Effects and try to insert that in there.
</p>
<div class="gallery">

<a>11/09/2020</a>
<p>I spent part of today just creating the other artboards for all the pages I'll have in my app. I've linked almost them all to each other, and have created "register" and "log in" pages as well as finished the "menu" page. Originally I wanted the menu to overlay but Invision Studio doesn't offer that function, so I just made it on a different page with the same background. Hopefully I can continue tweaking it so it looks more like an overlay. </p>

		<a>12/09/2020</a>
		<p>Today I focussed on getting the Help/FAQ page instructions written out and placed on the page. I also created the log out ending screen, and checked all the interactions between pages so far were correct using the pairing application that allowed me to pair my laptop and phone and mirror the prototype onto my phone screen. I'm so happy with how it looks and feels so far!</p>
		<div class="gallery">
											<a href="images/5.png" class="landscape"><img src="images/5.png" alt="" /></a>
										</div>
										<p></p>
<a>13/09/2020</a>
<p>Today I focussed on the "example" screens that pop up if you click on of the exclamation points on the Earth.
</p><p>
As Invision Studios doesn't support mp4 or gif files, I've had to make the globe static (which isn't really ideal but it's just going to have to be like that for this project, as I think I've put in too much effort to try and start again with a totally new software). However, as this is just a prototype of how the app would look and feel, I'm not overly concerned. The effect is still there, it just doesn't move.
</p><p>
Today I also finetuned the interactions between pages/artboards, to create a smoother feeling. Once again, I paired my phone so that I could see what it felt like clicking through the pages on my phone.
</p><p>
Tomorrow I'll focus on finishing the final two pages ("News" and "Random"/"Discovery") and then the app prototype should be finished. I'll then be able to work on the website component, which I'm actually still a little bit confused about but I'll ask in class this week.

<a>14/09/2020</a>
<p>Today I finished off my app prototype,  by creating the "news" page and linking the "random" button to one of the example info pages. I think the news page came out really well, it looks kind of professional and really clean.
</p><p>
My next steps will be creating the website to go with the prototype, and then eventually recording the video presentation for the final submission.

							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> Overall, I think the prototype came out as well as I could make it.
								Originally my idea was very different, and while I think the animation idea might have been better in demonstrating what the app would really feel and work like, it wouldn't be interactive, which is arguably the most important aspect of a prototype.
								With the prototype made in Invision Studios, users can really test for themselves what the app would act and feel like, and I'm happy with the outcome (even if it isn't exactly what I originally intended).
